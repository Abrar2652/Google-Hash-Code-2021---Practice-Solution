# Google-Hash-Code-2021---Practice-Solution

Google Hash Code is a coding competition held each year for the developers assigned with optimization problems. There is no perfect solution but we can reach close to the perfect score applying viable algorithms. The problem can be solved using different approaches that differs from time and space complexities. This is a team-based competition; so the team whose algorithm targets for more generalized solution tends to optimize the code till the last moment. The best score is taken under the consideration as the final score. 

This is my simple brute-force approach using combinatorics with Python 3 which creates time complexity in case of larger datasets. So it's not an optimal solution. Since this is out first Hash Code Competition so I'm satisfied with our attempts.

The best approach to solve this with Python would be using Object Oriented Programming. My brute force approach is quite straight forward, works well for small datasets and creates greater time complexities. This problem gave me insights about optimization and pushed me beyond my imagination to think out of the box.
